        ' "to JESUS CHRIST the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks.

        ' "Therefore, since we have been justified by His Blood, how much more shall we be saved from wrath through Him!

        ' "Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand GOD\'s will. Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the HOLY SPIRIT.

Sing and make music in your hearts to the LORD, always giving thanks to GOD the FATHER for everything in the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST." - Ephesians 5:17 - 20 ',
        ' "But in your hearts, sanctify JESUS CHRIST as GOD. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope you possess.

        ' "For it is better, if it is GOD\'s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.

He was put to death in the Body but made alive in the Spirit, in which He also went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when GOD waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built. In the ark, a few people, only eight souls were saved through water. And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also - not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of a clear conscience toward GOD - through the resurrection of JESUS CHRIST, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of GOD, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him. " - 1 Peter 3:17 - 22',

So great is Your power that Your enemies cower before You. All the earth bows down to You; they sing praise to You; they sing praise to Your name.\" Come and see the works of GOD; how awesome are His deeds toward mankind." - Psalm 66:1 - 5',
        ' "What then shall we say in response to these things? If GOD is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own SON, but gave Him up for us all; how will He not also, along with Him; freely give us all \'good\' things? Who will bring any charge against GOD\'s elect? It is GOD who justifies..." - Romans 8:31 - 33 ',
        ' "Who is there to condemn us? For CHRIST JESUS who died, and more than that was raised to life, is at the right hand of GOD - and He is interceding for us..." - Romans 8:34 ',
        ' "Who shall separate us from the love of CHRIST? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: \"For Your sake, we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" No, in all these things; we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us..." - Romans 8:35 - 37 ',
        ' "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of GOD that is in CHRIST JESUS our LORD." - Romans 8:38 - 39 ',
